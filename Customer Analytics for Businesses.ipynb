    "- Customers are the primary source of income for any business.\n",
    "- Almost all avenues for maximizing revenue and minimizing costs in a business is directly related to customers.\n",
    "- Elevating customer experience and satisfaction should be a prime concern for any business.\n",
    "- A business should learn how to meet and exceed primary needs of its customer.\n",
    "- Customer Analytics is a means for understanding the customer in order to do so.\n",
    "- In customer analytics, customer data is analyzed in order to gain insights about the customer and their needs.\n",
    "- It helps businesses measure and improve their products/services consistently so as to cater to the changing needs of their customers.\n",
    "- It also provides a means to analyze what methods/channels of customer acquisition and retention are working and what is not.\n",
    "- Having a track of such metrics as a whole gives a business a much needed edge over competing businesses in order to maximize profit.\n",

    "##### Drive Customer Acquisition\n",
    "* Helps focus on channels that drive the most new customers.\n",
    "* Helps to understand the most common customer journey from awareness to advocacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Improve Engagement\n",
    "* Helps to identify what type of feature resonates with which type of customer.\n",

    "##### 4. Understanding Customer Data\n",
    "- Knowing about what data to collect and use will help in interpreting the data for maximum benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Customer Analytics, we work with mainly two types of data: Quantitative and Qualitative\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Quantitative Data\n",
    "- Data in the form of numbers and counts\n",
    "- This data can be used for numerical operations, mathematical calculations, and statistical analysis.\n",
    "- Can be further classified into: Discrete and Continuous values.\n",
    "- Discrete values are metircs that are finite and countable. Foe instance, the number of customers signups, the number of product reviews, etc. are the examples of discrete values.\n",
    "- Continuous values are metrics that are not finite and range between certain values. For instance, the time taken by a customer to checkout after adding to cart is an example of a continuous value. e.g.4.5608... seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Qualitative Data\n",
    "- It can be defined as the data that can be described but not measured.\n",
    "- It can be observed and recorded and is non-numerical in nature.\n",
    "- It is also known as nominal or categorical data as this data can be grouped according to categories.\n",
    "- For instance, product reviews given by customers (good/bad/neutral) is an example of qualitative data.\n",
    "- Qualitative data helps bridge the gap between insights recorded from a quantitative analysis.\n",
    "- With these insights, we can gian an in-depth understanding of the 'why', that is, the underlying reasons and motivations for certain actions of the customers."

    "- Based on the information being collected, customer data can be broadly categorized as,\n",
    "    - Descriptive\n",
    "    - Behavioral\n",
    "    - Interaction\n",
    "    - Psychological\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Descriptive data is based on demographics such as age, gender, geography, and income.\n",
    "- Behavioral data is based on behaviors exhibited while browsing, making purchases, registering, etc.\n",
    "- Interaction data is based on actions such as clicks, navigation paths, and browsing activities.\n",
    "- Psychological data is based on preferences, personality, reviews and interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some of the common mistakes people make in collecting data for customer analytics include,\n",
    "    - Creating lengthy sign-up forms.\n",
    "    - Making extended checkout processes.\n",
    "    - Trying to monitor every action of the customer, for collecting as much data as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This hampers customer experiences badly and can even lead to a violation of customer trust and privacy.\n",
    "- So, it is important to understand how you can start collecting the right data for your business from the right sources.\n",
    "- Each and every data point you collect should be directed towards measuring the factors that determine customer value, such as,\n",
    "    - Customer Experience,\n",
    "    - Loyalty, and\n",
    "    - Revenue\n",
    "    \n",

    "    - Tracking improvements over time, and\n",

    "- Analysis of customer data is primarily focused towards making better business decisions.\n",
    "- Qualitative data is comparitively harder to analyze than quantitative data as it tends to be subjective and varies from person-to-person.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Irrespective of the data type, the complexity of the analysis is mostly dependent on the methods used and the amount of data collected.\n",

    "- Using Diagnostic Analytics, we can diagnose that the cause for the large number of customers coming in from Europe is because the online retail store must have heavily marketed itself in Europe rather than the other countries.\n",
    "- Using Predictive Analytics, we can predict that the online retail store will continue getting more customers from the United Kingdom since there is already massive number of customers base in the United Kingdom.\n",

    "##### 9. Customer Profiling and Segmentation - Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer profiling and segmentation is one of the best ways to learn about the characterstics of customers.\n",
    "- Understanding and grouping your customers aids in serving their needs better which in turn helps in the growth of the business.\n",
    "- Finding the similarities abd differences between your customers is crucial in identifying the customer's relationship with the business.\n",
    "- It helps to determine who the customers are, what they do, what are their interests and what choices do they make collectively.\n",
    "- The first and foremost step while profiling and segementing your customers is to determine what metric makes sense for your business.\n",
    "- It requires a combination of facts and intuition to decide what attributes can help best describe your customers.\n",
    "- For an online store, the gender of a customer of the time of the day might be an important metric that determines what products a customer buys.\n",
    "- However, for an ailine company, the metric might be completely different such as the frequency of the travel that determines how valuable the customer is.\n",
    "- A common method to profile and segment customers in any business is to look at their amount, recency and frequency of purchase.\n",
    "- When all of these three metirces are analyzed, it is termed as RFM analysis.\n",
    "- R = Recency, F = Frequency, M = Monetary Value\n",
    "- RFM Analysis is a powerful method for customer profiling and segmentation since it looks at three different metrics in light of each other.\n",
    "- It groups customers based on their latest activity, frequency of transactions, and revenue generated while interacting with the business.\n",
    "- Recency(R): the most recent purchase within a time frame.\n",
    "- Frequency(F): the number of purchases within a time frame.\n",
    "- Monetary value(M): the total value of purchase amount, i.e., the revenue within a time frame."
